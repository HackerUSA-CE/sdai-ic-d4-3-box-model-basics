# Together - Editing Box Model Properties ðŸ“–

**Description:**
Students will practice editing the box model properties of button and card examples alongside the instructor with step-by-step guidance. This includes modifying padding, margins, and borders on pre-made classes, and inspecting the changes using the Chrome Inspector tool.

## ToDo list âœ…

1. [ ] **Task 1:** Follow along with the instructor to modify the box model properties of the button example.
    - **Subtask 1:** Open `examples/button/button.html` and `examples/button/styles.css` in your code editor. View `button.html` in your web browser. Refresh the page to immediately see any changes as you make them.
    - **Subtask 2:** Increase the padding of the buttons to `1em 1.5em`. Refresh the page to see the effects.
    - **Subtask 3:** Set a margin of `1em` around each button. Refresh the page to see the effects.
    - **Subtask 4:** Set a border of `0.2em solid #333` (or a different size and color of your choice) on the buttons. Refresh the page to see the effects.
    - **Subtask 5:** Use the Chrome Inspector tool to verify the changes and inspect the computed styles.

2. [ ] **Task 2:** Follow along with the instructor to modify the box model properties of the card example.
    - **Subtask 1:** Open `examples/card/cards.html` and `examples/card/styles.css` in your code editor. View `cards.html` in your web browser. Refresh the page to immediately see any changes as you make them.
    - **Subtask 2:** Increase the padding of the cards to `1.5em`. Refresh the page to see the effects.
    - **Subtask 3:** Add a margin of `1.5em` around each card. Refresh the page to see the effects.
    - **Subtask 4:** Set a border of `0.15em solid #555` (or a different size and color of your choice) to the cards. Refresh the page to see the effects.
    - **Subtask 5:** Use the Chrome Inspector tool to verify the changes and inspect the computed styles.
